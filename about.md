=======

When I was younger, my mother took my sister and I to see a witch doctor. 

The doctor lived in the jungle, and occasionaly took care of the local villagers. As per his title, he was known to be a man connected deeply with the spirits.

The doctor, if you believe the rumors, was thought to be able to cure any sickness, mend any injury. He was also known to be a man capable of glimpsing into the souls of the living.

And so of course, the doctor did what most doctors do. 

He examined my sister and I.

The doctor found that my sister was enlightened, that she would become devine. However, he would not lay a hand on me, stating that my aura was dark and consuming. I never really believed in the power of black magic, but those words stuck to me, crawling into one of those annoying little crevices you can never really reach.

Even now, half a world away, those words follow me like some insane dark prophecy. I guess you can say that's where it all started. If i was going to be a part of one worlds darkness, I wanted to find a world where i could become a part of the light. 

And what easier way to find that world, then learning how to build it yourself.
